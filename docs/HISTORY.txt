1.0b6 - 2009-11-17
------------------

* Fix tests for Zope 2.12
  [optilude]

1.0b5 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. 
  enumerate_behaviors() becomes enumerateBehaviors().
  [optilude]

1.0b4 - 2009-06-07
------------------

* Allow a marker-interface-only behavior to be set by using the 'provides'
  attribute (previously 'interface') in the <plone:behavior /> directive
  without a 'factory' attribute. The 'marker' attribute (previously known as
  'subtype') is now only required if there is a marker used in addition to
  a behavior adapter with a separate interface ('provides') and factory.
  [optilude]

* Rename the 'interface' attribute of <plone:behavior /> to 'provides' to
  be more consistent with the <adapter /> directive. This is a backwards
  incompatible change!
  [optilude]

* Rename the 'subtype' attribute of <plone:behavior /> to 'marker' to
  be more explicit about its purpose. This is a backwards
  incompatible change!
  [optilude]  

1.0b3 - 2009-04-17
------------------

* Allow behaviors with no factory.
  [alecm]

* Provide a vocabulary of available behaviors.
  [davisagli]

1.0b1 - 2008-04-27
------------------

* Initial release
